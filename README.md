## Repository Structure

This repository is meticulously organized into key sections, progressing from fundamental concepts to practical application and core automation logic. Each top-level folder contains its own dedicated $\text{README.md}$ file, providing in-depth explanations, examples, and usage instructions for the content within.

### 1\. Introduction to CM and Ansible

  * **Description:** A foundational guide covering **Configuration Management (CM)** principles, the need for automation, and what makes **Ansible** unique (agentless architecture, simplicity, security).
  * **Explore:** Navigate to [Introduction to CM and Ansible](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Introduction%2520to%2520CM%2520and%2520Ansible/) for detailed information.

### 2\. Managed Nodes and Inventory Management

  * **Description:** Learn how Ansible identifies and connects to the machines it manages. This section focuses on setting up your **Control Node**, configuring **SSH keys**, and mastering the **Inventory** file (static and dynamic).
  * **Explore:** Navigate to [Managed Nodes and Inventory Management](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Managed%2520Nodes%2520and%2520Inventory%2520Management/) for detailed information.

### 3\. Management of EC2 Instances

  * **Description:** Apply your inventory knowledge to a real-world cloud environment. This section details how to dynamically discover, provision, and manage **AWS EC2 instances** using Ansible's cloud-specific modules.
  * **Explore:** Navigate to [Management of EC2 Instances](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Management%2520of%2520EC2%2520Instances/) for detailed information.
